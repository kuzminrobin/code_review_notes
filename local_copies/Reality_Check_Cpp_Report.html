<h3>Reality Check</h3>

</dt><dt>March 1996<p>

	If your life is anything like mine, you're bombarded daily
with a barrage of technical information from journals, email,
newpapers, and netnews.  In these hectic times, I consider it a luxury
to read an entire magazine cover-to-cover.  In fact, one of the best
things about being the editor of C++ Report is that I'm "forced" to
read all the articles and columns carefully each month.  In addition
to keeping me plugged in to the state-of-the-art in C++ and
object-oriented system development, I frequently gain new insights
that save much significant software development effort.  I'd like to
relate an experience along these lines that happened last week while I
was reviewing John Vlissides "Patterns Hatching" column for the April
'96 issue of C++ Report. </p><p>

	As I'm sure you know, John's been describing various design
patterns from the GoF (GoF stands for "Gang of Four," which is the
name affectionately given to the authors of "Design Patterns: Elements
of Reusable Object-Oriented Software") book [1] (such as Visitor and
Template method) that arise when developing a file system.  In his
April '96 column, John will discuss a pattern for protecting files
from unauthorized access in multiuser environments.  Without giving
away too much of his column's plot, the pattern John focuses on is
Singleton.  The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one
instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. </p><p>

	I began reading John's draft while taking a break from some
marathon C++ debugging sessions.  We'd been having some mysterious
problems with memory leaks when running a multi-threaded version of my
ACE C++ network programming framework on our 20-CPU SPARCcenter 2000
multi-processor at Washington University.  Needlesstosay, tracking
down bugs in complex concurrent programs is about as much fun as
debugging device drivers written in assembly language.</p><p>

	As I read John's column, however, I suddenly realized the
problems we'd observed were due to race conditions in our Singleton
initialization code.  It turns out the canonical implementation of the
Singleton pattern in the GoF book does not work in the presence of
preemptive multi-tasking or true parallelism, which our 20-CPU
SPARCcenter 2000 has in spades.  This is a classic example of how
changes in underlying forces (e.g., the addition of multi-threading
and parallelism to Singleton) can significantly affect the form and
content of patterns we use to develop software.</p><p>

	Fortunately, the solution is straightforward -- we dubbed it
the "Double-Check" pattern for reasons that will become clear below.
After we applied the fixes to ACE, Tim Harrison and I documented our
solution in pattern form so that others could learn from our
experience (and avoid the headaches... ;-)).  I've enclosed an
abridged version of the Double-Check pattern below.  The complete
description of the Double-Check pattern is available online in
postscript form at WWW URL <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TSS-pattern.ps.gz">http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TSS-pattern.ps.gz</a>.</p><p>

<h4>Double-Check</h4>

<ol>
<li> Intent<p>

Allow atomic initialization, regardless of initialization order, and
eliminates subsequent locking overhead.

</p></li><li> Motivation and Implementation<p>

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and
provides a global point of access to that instance.  Dynamically
allocating Singletons in C++ programs is common since the order of
initialization of global static objects in C++ programs is not
well-defined and is thus non-portable.  Moreover, dynamic allocation
avoids the cost of initializing a Singleton if it is never used. </p><p>

Defining a Singleton is straightforward:

</p><pre>class Singleton
{
public:
  static Singleton *instance (void) {
    if (instance_ == NULL)
      instance_ = new Singleton;

    return instance_;
  }

  void method (void);
  // Other methods omitted.

private:
  static Singleton *instance_;

  // Other data members omitted.
};
</pre>

Application code uses the static Singleton instance() method to
retrieve a reference to the Singleton before performing operations, as
follows:<p>

</p><pre>  // ...
  Singleton::instance ()-&gt;method ();
  // ...
</pre>

Unfortunately, if multiple threads executing on a parallel machine
call Singleton::instance() simultaneously before it is initialized,
the Singleton constructor can be called multiple times.  This, at
best, will cause a memory leak and, at worst, may have disastrous
consequences if initialization is not idempotent (idempotent
initialization can occur multiple times without ill effects). <p>

One way to solve this problem is to add a static Mutex to the class.
This Mutex ensures that the allocation and initialization of the
Singleton occurs atomically, as follows: </p><p>

</p><pre>class Singleton
{
public:
  static Singleton *instance (void)
  {
    // Constructor of guard acquires 
    // lock_ automatically.
    Guard<mutex> guard (lock_);

    // Only one thread in the 
    // critical section at a time.

    if (instance_ == NULL)
        instance_ = new Singleton;

    return instance_;
    // Destructor of guard releases
    // lock_ automatically.
  }

private:
  static Mutex lock_;
  static Singleton *instance_;
};
</mutex></pre>

The Guard class employs a C++ idiom (first described in [2]) that uses
the constructor to acquire a resource automatically when an object of
the class is created and uses the destructor to release the resource
automatically when it goes out of scope.  Since Guard is parameterized
by the type of lock (such as Mutex), this class can be used with a
family of synchronization wrappers that conform to a uniform
acquire()/release() interface.  By using Guard, every access to
Singleton::instance() will automatically acquire and release the
lock_. <p>

Although this implementation is now thread-safe, this approach will
cause excessive locking overhead and decrease performance.  One
obvious (though incorrect) optimization is to place the Guard inside
the conditional check of instance_: </p><p>

</p><pre>static Singleton *instance (void)
{
  if (instance_ == NULL)
  {
    Guard<mutex> guard (lock_);

    // Only come here if instance_
    // hasn't been initialized yet.

    instance_ = new Singleton;
  }
  return instance_;
}
</mutex></pre>

Although this reduces locking overhead it doesn't provide thread-safe
initialization.  There is still a race condition in multi-threaded
applications that can cause multiple initializations of instance_. <p>

Therefore, the best way to solve this problem is to use the
Double-Check pattern.  This pattern allows dynamic allocation and
initialization of Singletons to occur atomically, while eliminating
locking overhead for each access.  Ironically, this solution is almost
identical to the previous one.  Unnecessary locking is avoided by
wrapping the previous implementation with one addition conditional
test, as follows: </p><p>

</p><pre>class Singleton
{
public:
  static Singleton *instance (void)
  {
    // First check
    if (instance_ == NULL)
    {
      // Ensure serialization (guard
      // constructor acquires lock_).
      Guard<mutex> guard (lock_);

      // Double check
      if (instance_ == NULL)
        instance_ = new Singleton;
    }
    return instance_;
    // guard destructor releases lock_.
  }

private:
  static Mutex lock_;
  static Singleton *instance_;
};
</mutex></pre>

The first thread that acquires lock_ will construct Singleton and
assign the pointer to instance_.  All threads that subsequently call
instance() will find instance_ != NULL and skip the initialization
step.  The second check prevents a race condition if multiple threads
try to initialize the Singleton simultaneously.  This handles the case
where multiple threads execute in parallel.  In the code above, these
threads will queue up at lock_.  When the queued threads finally
obtain the mutex lock_, they will find instance_ != NULL and not try
to reinitialize Singleton. <p>

Note that the implementation of Singleton::instance() above only
incurs locking overhead for threads that are active inside of
instance() when the Singleton is first initialized.  Subsequent calls
to Singleton::instance(), singleton_ is not NULL and the lock_ is not
acquired or released. </p><p>

</p></li><li> Applicability <p>

Use the Double-Check Pattern when an application has the following
characteristics: </p><p>

</p><ul>
<li> The application is multi-threaded and uses Singletons; <p>

</p></li><li> Singleton initialization is either dynamic and/or not
	  idempotent; <p>

</p></li><li> The Singleton instance() method can potentially be called
	  simultaneously by multiple threads; <p>

</p></li><li> The memory architecture of the OS/platform and the compiler
	  support atomic tests for NULL.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p></p><hr><p>

	My experience with Singleton, ACE, and Double-Check over the
past week reinforced several important points.  First, it's
interesting to observe how patterns generate solutions to programming
problems.  Once I recognized the connection between Singleton and ACE
memory leaks, and factored out the key forces (e.g., preemptive
multi-threading, no locking overhead for normal use of the Singleton,
etc.)  the solution jumped right out.  This illustrates the generative
nature of patterns.  I was able to solve a vexing problem by
recognizing how to extend an existing pattern (Singleton) to yield a
newly documented pattern (Double-Check).  It's instructive to note how
the need for Double-Check emerged from a change in forces, i.e., the
addition of multi-threading and parallelism "broke" Singleton. </p><p>
		
	Second, keeping up-to-date with technical literature is an
investment in yourself that can really pay off.  I saved myself many
hours of frustration by taking the time to read John's column.  Of
course, it was serendipitous that his column appeared just when I'd
reached my wits end trying to debug memory leaks in multi-threaded ACE
software.  In general, however, I'm impressed by how much useful
knowledge I gain each month reading articles and columns in the C++
Report. </p><p>

	Speaking of columns, I'd like to welcome two new columnists to
the C++ Report this month.  Jack Reeves and Doug Forguson are joining
the team -- starting off with feature articles, as is our custom now.
Both are very talented developers and authors, who will cover topics
ranging from C++ error handling to graphical user interfaces.  I hope
you can find time in your hectic lives to keep plugged in to the
state-of-the-art in C++ and object-oriented systems in the C++ Report. </p><p>
