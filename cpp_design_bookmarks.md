Certain Code Fragments Should Not Throw Exceptions
-
In general that's the code that is executed from the moment when the execption is thrown and until entering the `catch`-handler (i.e. during the _stack unwinding process_, see [[e&su]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/article_list.md)). Some of that code is implicitly generated by the compiler (hiddenly from the programmer).  
The programmer-written code fragments are  
* _destructors_, see  
Meyers' [[EC++3]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/book_list.md), _Item 8: Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors_,  
Sutter's [[ExcC++]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/book_list.md), _Item8: Writing Exception-Safe Code - Part1_.  
* `operator delete`, `operator delete[]`, see  
Haldar's [[t15c++ehm]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/article_list.md), _Mistake # 5: Throwing exceptions in destructors or in overloaded delete or delete[] operator_.  
* _constructors of the exception classes_, see  
Haldar's [[t15c++ehm]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/article_list.md), _Mistake # 12: Throwing exception in an exception class constructor_.

C++ Exception Specifications
-

The Herb Sutter's article ["A Pragmatic Look at Exception Specifications"](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill22.htm) ([[pl@es]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/article_list.md)) makes think that the exception specifications  
* instead of providing the _compile-time_ nothrow-guarantee (`throw()`) or throws-only-these-ones-gaurantee (`throw(A, B)`)  
* provide the _run-time_ checks/asserts (which are _pessimization_, i.e. they lower down the performance).  

Another confirmation is in [[eses]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/edit/master/article_list.md).  

The Meyers' [[EMC++]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/book_list.md), _Item 14: Declare functions `noexcept` if they won’t emit exceptions_,  
in the beginning makes one think that `noexcept` helps to optimize in certain cases (by means of replacing the copy operations with the move operations). But in the end still shows that there are no any _copile-time_ guarantees (a `noexcept`-function can call the functions without the exception specification, and the compilers (so far) don't complain) but there are _run-time_ checks ("_your program will be terminated if an exception tries to leave the function_").  
See also [t15c++ehm], [_Mistake # 9: Not realizing the implications of "noexcept" specification_](http://www.acodersjourney.com/2016/08/top-15-c-exception-handling-mistakes-avoid/).

C++ Exceptions: TODO.
-
* Concise high-level explanation of what the C++ exceptions are for, is it possible to live without the exceptions (with the exceptions completely disabled at compile time)? If yes then what is the cost?  
(Member vars that are arrays are inited by calling the default Ctor for each array element, if those Ctors acquire the resources then that acquisition can fail, how to return such a failure from the default Ctor?  
How and to who to return the failure from a Ctor of a global var? What happens if the global var Ctor throws?)
* In which cases is it _impossible_ to use the exceptions? Bare metal? (no OS to terminate the code that does not handle the exc)
* Some articles state that today's compilers generate such a code that the exceptions have _zero-cost in successful case_ (i.e. the exception is not thrown), but [Walter Bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bright) (creator of D) said (at http://nwcpp.org/ [November 2017 meeting](http://nwcpp.org/november-2017.html)) that _zero-cost exceptions are a myth_. Who is right? What particularly stands behind (what code is generated upon) `try`, `catch(T)`, `catch(...)`, `throw`, thrown-case, not-thrown-case, etc.? At C++Now2018's ["How Compilers Reason About Exceptions"](https://cppnow2018.sched.com/event/EC7V/how-compilers-reason-about-exceptions) session it has been recommended to read the ABI docs and the [[.eh_f]](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/article_list.md) Airs – Ian Lance Taylor. _".eh_frame"_ (still TODO).
