# code_review_notes

[book_list.md](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/book_list.md)  
This is a list of C++ (and other system programming) books sorted by publication date.
While reading the C++ books from time to time I notice that the authors give contradicting advice. Typically a book published later is based on more knowledge and deserves more attention.
