### The code_review_notes Repository.

[book_list.md](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/book_list.md)  
This is a list of C++ (and other system programming) books _sorted by publication date_.  
While reading the C++ books from time to time I notice that the authors give the contradicting pieces of advice. Typically a book published later is based on more knowledge and deserves more attention while resolving the contradictions. 

[article_list.md](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/article_list.md)  
Chronological List of key C++ Articles and Other Resources.

[local_copies](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/tree/master/local_copies)  
Local copies of the key C++ Articles, Libraries, etc. that are about to be lost (or are hard to find) in the web.
